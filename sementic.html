            <h2>Heyy, It's me your childhood game partner MARIO</h2>
            <p>Mario is a fictional character created by Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. He is the title
                character of the Mario video game franchise and the mascot of Japanese video game company Nintendo.
                Mario has appeared in over 200 video games since his creation.
                Depicted as a short, pudgy, Italian plumber who resides in the Mushroom Kingdom, his adventures
                generally center on rescuing Princess Peach from the Koopa villain Bowser. Mario has access to a variety
                of power-ups that give him different abilities. Mario's fraternal twin brother and sidekick is Luigi.

        <p class="box">Scientists found that playing Super Mario can make you brainier, or at least cause increases in
            the brain regions responsible for spatial orientation, memory formation and strategic planning.Regularly
            playing Super Mario 64 for six months seemed to improve memory and increase the amount of grey matter in the
            brains of older adults, ages 55 to 75. </p>
